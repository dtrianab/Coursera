Evidence for a hypothesis is always relative to another competing hypothesis.
Always ask "Compared to what"

## Principle 2: Show causality, mechanism, explanation, systematic structure
Show your causal framework for thinking about a question. 

## Principle 3: Show multivariate data
>2 Variables | need to "escape flatland"

## Principle 4: Integrate differrent modes of evidence
 - Completely integrate words, numbers, images, diagrams.
 - Data graphics should make use of many models of data presentation√ß
 - Dont let the tool drive the analysis

## Principle 5: Describe and document the evidence with appropiate labels, scales, sources etc.
A data graphic should tell a completely story that is credible

## Principle 6: Content is king 
Analytical presentations ultimatley stand or fall depending on the quality, relevance, and integrity of their content.
