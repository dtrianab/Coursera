### Types of analysis

- Descriptive: Describe and summarize a set of data.
- Exploratory: Examine the data and find relationships (Correlation does not imply causation).
- Inferential: Use a relatively small sample of data to say something about the population at large.
- Predictive: Use current and historical data to make predictions about  future data.
- Causal: What happends to one variable when we manipulate another.
- Mechanistic: Understand exact changed in variables that lead to exact cha in another variables.



### Experimental Design 

Formulate your question > Design your experiment
Identify problems and source of error, Collect the data, Ellaborate the hypothesis. Sample size?.

*Confounder Variables*: Extraneous variable that may effect the relationship between the dependent and independent variables.

When the stakes are this high, experimental design is paramount.

### Replication

**p-value** >> This is a value that tells you the probability that the results of your experiment were observed by chance.

### Big Data

 - Volume, Velocity, Variety
 - Unstructured -> Format that cna be analyzided 
 - Right data for the question?

 The combination of some data and an aching desire for an answer does not ensure that a reasonable answer can be extracted from a given body of data
